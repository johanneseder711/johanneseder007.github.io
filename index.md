Robbins was criticized for critical comments made about the Me Too movement at a seminar in San Jose, California, on March 15, 2018.[33] According to a video of the event released on social media by NowThisNews,[34] Robbins stated his opinion that, "If you use the #MeToo movement to try to get significance and certainty by attacking and destroying someone else… all you've done is basically use a drug called significance to make yourself feel good." He went on to tell a story about a "very powerful man" who passed on hiring a female candidate even though she was the most qualified because she was too attractive and would be "too big a risk".[33] Following criticism for these comments, Robbins posted an apology on his Facebook page, saying "I apologize for suggesting anything other than my profound admiration for the #MeToo movement."
